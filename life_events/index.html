            While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
            dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his
            scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three
            days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to
            him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a
            difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of
            becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only
            eight positions were available in the IAF.

            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member
            of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his
            career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by
            his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR
            committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space
            scientist.

            Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the
            Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of
            which proved to be successful.

            In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and
            Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the
            technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval
            of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret
            funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers
            under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing
            the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified
            aerospace projects.

            Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister
            and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation
            from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were
            conducted during this period in which he played an intensive
            political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project
            Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing
            phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the
            country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the
            site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a
            "fizzle" and criticisied Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both
            Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.
