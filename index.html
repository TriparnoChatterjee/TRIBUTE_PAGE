                    <div class="para_1">
                        <p>
                            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a
                            Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
                            Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
                            Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local
                            mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry
                            that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the
                            now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers
                            and one sister in his family.His ancestors had been wealthy traders
                            and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.
                            Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
                            and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
                            pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a result, the family
                            acquired the title of "Mara Kalam Iyakkivar" (wooden boat steerers),
                            which over the years became shortened to "Marakier." With the
                            opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
                            businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost
                            over time, apart from the ancestral home.By his early childhood,
                            Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers
                            to supplement his family's income.

                        <p>
                            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a
                            bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He
                            spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.After completing
                            his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
                            Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College,
                            Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
                            where he graduated in physics in 1954.He moved to Madras in 1955 to
                            study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While
                            Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
                            dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his
                            scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three
                            days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to
                            him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a
                            difficult deadline".He narrowly missed achieving his dream of
                            becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only
                            eight positions were available in the IAF.

                            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
                            Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
                            Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member
                            of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his
                            career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by
                            his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR
                            committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space
                            scientist.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space
                            Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of
                            India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully
                            deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980;
                            Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
                            independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the
                            government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
                            engineers.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as
                            the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the
                            1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to
                            develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.Despite the
                            disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these
                            aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an
                            integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified
                            aerospace projects.His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and
                            prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme
                            under his directorship.Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the
                            Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a
                            proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles
                            one after another.R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating
                            â‚¹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP)
                            and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles
                            under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the
                            tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for
                            mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

                            Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                            presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by
                            Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.During his term as president,
                            he was affectionately known as the People's President

                            On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet
                            Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he
                            experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.At around
                            6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.He was rushed to the nearby
                            Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of
                            life.Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden
                            cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST.
